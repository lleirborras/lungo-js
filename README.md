# lungo-js
### A simple Sinatra app to help testing Lungo.js

By now, it responds to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests, by returning a JSON object like this:

 { get: PARAMS }

where PARAMS are the parameters send in the request.

[Source code](https://github.com/lleirborras/lungo-js) and [issue tracking](http://github.com/lleirborras/lungo-js/issues) are available on Github.

[Demo](http://lungo-js.heroku.com) is available on Heroku
